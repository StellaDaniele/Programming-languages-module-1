# Programming Languages - module 1

This is the second part of my exam for the course "Programming languages module 1" at UniTn. This module of the course was about object-oriented programming in general, indeed the first part of the exam was theoretical about the OOP. To practice the concepts studied during the course we used Java, also using JavaFX to realize some simple 2D applications. The goal for this second part was to realize a program using Java and JavaFX.<br>

Grade: 30/30 with honours (maximum score in both the parts).

It is a minimal "online shop" with some features listed in the <a href="./CompitoLinguaggiSettembre21.pdf">exam paper</a>.
The exam was not only about programming something working, but to program paying attention to the good practices of the OOP and producing some well-organized code.
